I'll create a Pydantic model based on the contact information form shown in the image.

<python>
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, EmailStr
from typing import Optional

class ContactInformation(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Full name")
    email: EmailStr = Field(..., description="Email address")
    address: str = Field(..., description="Physical address")
    phone_number: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Phone number")
    comments: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Additional comments")
    
    class Config:
        schema_extra = {
            "example": {
                "name": "LucasName",
                "email": "example@email.com",
                "address": "123 Main St, City, Country",
                "phone_number": "+1234567890",
                "comments": "Additional information goes here"
            }
        }
</python>

The model includes all the fields visible in the form:
- Name (marked as required with an asterisk)
- Email (marked as required with an asterisk)
- Address (marked as required with an asterisk)
- Phone number (optional)
- Comments (optional)

I've used EmailStr for email validation and added descriptions and an example to make the model more usable.
