Based on the image, I can see a "Job Info Extractor" form with several fields for collecting job-related information. I'll create a Pydantic model that represents this form:

<python>
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class JobInfo(BaseModel):
    job_title: str
    company: str
    location: str
    job_description: str
</python>

This Pydantic model includes all the visible fields from the form: job title, company, location, and job description. Each field is set as a string type to match the text input fields shown in the form. The model will validate that all these required fields are present when data is submitted.
